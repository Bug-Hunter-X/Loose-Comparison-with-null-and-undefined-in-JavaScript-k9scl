# Loose Comparison with null and undefined in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving loose comparison (==) with null and undefined values.  The loose comparison operator does not distinguish between null and undefined, leading to unexpected results when checking for either value. 

The file `bug.js` showcases the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using strict equality (===).
